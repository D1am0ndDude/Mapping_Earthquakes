# Summary
This projects purpose was to get an overveiw of the tectonic plates, and earthquakes from the last 7 days. We used URLs to grab data, instead of the need to physically download data. We go step by step to see what is required to create these maps. 

# For public use
For anyone who wants to learn how to do these, there are several files to look through, to get a step by step basic understanding of how you can create your own maps.
